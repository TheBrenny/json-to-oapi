# `json-to-oapi`

An easy Web App that converts [json-schema]() APIs to [OpenAPI]() APIs.

## Motivation

Insomnia didn't know how to handle JSON-Schema, so I found an NPM project which converts it to OpenAPI.

## Installation

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/TheBrenny/json-to-oapi.git
$ cd json-to-oapi
$ npm install --save-dev
$ http-server public
```

Install globally, or just use [this page]()!
